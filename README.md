# Sudoku-Puzzle-Solver (Java-Prolog)
This little application uses Java for the GUI and input. The input is then used to systematically write a Prolog file to solve the puzzle using the Prolog CLPFD library. The java code also runs the the Prolog query using the jpl7 library and then displays the output of the query to the GUI.
